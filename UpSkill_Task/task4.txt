Q-1==>  JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
        JSON is lightweight format for storing and transporting data.
        JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
        JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand.

        Sending Data :- If you have data in a javascript object,you can convert the object
                        into JSON,and send it to a server.
                        For example :- var example={name : "Tushar",age : 23,city: satara};
                                        var myFile=JSON.stringify(example);
                                        
        Receiving Data :- If you receive data in JSON format,you can convert it into a javascript object.
                        For example:- var example ='{"name" : "Tushar","age" : 23,"city": "satara"}';
                        var myFile =JSON.parse(example);

Q-2==>  A Constructor is a function that initialize an object.
        In javascript,there is special constructor function known as Object() is used to create and initialize
        an object.The return value of the Object() constructor is assigned to a variable.
        For Example :- function ABC(x,y){
                            this.m=x;
                            this.n=y;
                         }
                         var Obj = new ABC("Tushar","More");

Q-3==>  Using global object methods we can convert primitive values into non-primitive and vice-versa.
