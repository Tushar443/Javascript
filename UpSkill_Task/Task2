 1) Higher order function is a function that can take another function as a argument
	or that returns the function as result.
	For Example:- function test(){
					return function test2(){
					}
				  };
			      function test3(){};
			      test(test3);
			
 2) IIFE stands for immediately Invoked Function Expression and that runs as soon as it is defined
	it is design pattern which is also known as a self-Executing Anonymous Function and contains 
	two major parts.
	i)  The first is anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the grouping 
	    operator().
	ii) Second part creates the immediately invoked function expression () through which javascript
		engine will directly interpret the function.
	For example:- (function (){
					console.log('Hello'); //it will invoked itself.
				  })();
				  
 3) Fat arrow functions are more concise syntax for writing function expression.
	They utilize a new token =>,that looks like a fat arrow.
	Arrow functions are anonymous and change the way this binds in function.
		For example :- var add=(x,y)=>{
							console.log(x+y);
						};
